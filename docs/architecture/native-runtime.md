# Native Runtime and Ownership

## Dependency direction

The native dependency direction is core → URL/DOM → network/CSS/JavaScript →
layout → display list/raster → page orchestration → CLI or future window layer.
The scheduler remains an explicit service until browser/window orchestration
integrates it.

Public headers expose subsystem contracts; opaque handles isolate internal
state where practical. Subsystems that require direct DOM access share the one
canonical `TaiNode` representation in `include/tai/dom.h`; they do not define
private, incompatible node layouts.

## Ownership

- `TaiDocument` owns every DOM node. Parent links and layout/JavaScript node
  references are borrowed; JavaScript and layout activity ends before document
  destruction. Detached nodes remain alive until document destruction, so DOM
  mutation cannot leave JavaScript handles dangling.
- `TaiStylesheet` owns selectors and declarations. Computed style owns its
  string values.
- `TaiResponse` owns headers and body. Queue handoff transfers response
  ownership, and cancellation still destroys payloads.
- `TaiLayout` borrows the styled DOM and owns layout nodes, words, and font
  state. Construction reads styles and only mutates a fixed `overflow: scroll`
  node to persist its clamped `scroll_y`, matching the reference owner-thread
  behavior.
- `TaiDisplayList` copies command text, font names, colors, geometry, clip
  rectangles, scroll offsets, and scalar DOM node IDs; it keeps no DOM or
  layout pointers and can outlive both. Raw hit results retain only copied ID,
  kind, and bounds. `TaiPage` owns viewport dimensions and clamped page scroll,
  converts viewport coordinates to document coordinates once, and resolves the
  copied ID through its live document.
- Cairo contexts and surfaces are created and destroyed inside the synchronous
  PNG call. A future raster worker may receive a self-contained display list,
  never mutable DOM state.

## Current native rendering boundary

`tai_layout_visit` exposes flat borrowed geometry synchronously on the owner
thread. `tai_layout_walk` adds paired enter/leave events at the same seam so the
display-list builder can preserve effect nesting without exposing layout
implementation structs. `tai_display_list_write_png` and
`tai_display_list_hit_test` consume the resulting self-contained list. Hit
testing shares flat paint ordering and paired scroll effects with raster; the
small `TaiPage` adapter applies the shared viewport-to-document origin to hit
testing and viewport PNG raster, then resolves a successful hit to a live DOM
node. The display list remains immutable document-coordinate state. The CLI
owns the page/network/URL lifecycle and uses one
cleanup path for screenshot success and failure. Observable dimensions,
supported commands, coordinate semantics, test evidence, and missing paint
features belong to
[`docs/reference-render-contract.md`](../reference-render-contract.md).

## Runtime resources

The default CSS is an install-time resource rather than page-owned memory. Its
lookup order and installation evidence are tracked as migration state in
[`PORTING_PLAN.md`](../../PORTING_PLAN.md); the architectural constraint is that
checkout-specific absolute paths stay out of the binary.
